I attempt to use negative space, abstraction, lighting, smoke, and shadows as tools to not only create contrast and cinematographic composition, but by doing so, I hoped to direct viewers focal point to the subject itself."

I hoped to explore how color theory can be combined with photography to create compelling & cinematically pleasing images that enhance different viewer moods. While only a few photos were actually shot in SOHO - New York, I named this collection "SOHO" because the colors in this collection reminds me of SOHO's vibrancy.`
